# The-Lego-Shop
The main goal of this project is to provide information quality, system quality and service quality. The Information Quality dimension measures the e-commerce content. The System Quality dimension measures the desired characteristics of an e-commerce system. The Service Quality dimension measures e-commerce services. Purchasing and selling products and services over the internet without the need of going physically to the market is what online shopping all about. Online shopping is just like a retail store shopping that we do by going to the market, but it is done through the internet. Online shopping has made shopping painless and added more fun. Online stores offer product description, comparisons, price and much more.
